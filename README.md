Note: some of my files still have saucer shoot in the titles because I started with the finished saucer shoot and deleted everything so I was sure the filepaths were connected correctly. Then from there we started creating our game.

Files include header and source files for:
Block - objects the frog is trying to avoid
Dust - background particles
Frog - main character
GameOver
GameStart
Points - points system that increases with time

Compile by opening the project in Visual Studio Code and building and running (CTRL + Shift + B) and click the green play button at the top of the screen.
